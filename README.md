## Abstract:
We propose the first unified framework <em>UniColor</em> to support colorization in multiple modalities, including both unconditional and conditional ones, such as stroke, exemplar, text, and even a mix of them. Rather than learning a separate model for each type of condition, we introduce a two-stage colorization framework for incorporating various conditions into a single model. In the first stage, multi-modal conditions are converted into a common representation of hint points. Particularly, we propose a novel CLIP-based method to convert the text to hint points. In the second stage, we propose a Transformer-based network composed of <em>Chroma-VQGAN</em> and <em>Hybrid-Transformer</em> to generate diverse and high-quality colorization results conditioned on hint points. Both qualitative and quantitative comparisons demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in every control modality and further enables multi-modal colorization that was not feasible before. Moreover, we design an interactive interface showing the effectiveness of our unified framework in practical usage, including automatic colorization, hybrid-control colorization, local recolorization, and iterative color editing.

### Two-stage Method:
Our framework consists of two stages. In the first stage, all different conditions (stroke, exemplar, and text) are converted to a common form of hint points. In the second stage, diverse results are generated automatically either from scratch or based on the condition of hint points.

## Environments
To setup Anaconda environment:
```
$ conda env create -f environment.yaml
$ conda activate unicolor
```

## Pretrained Models
Download the pretrained models (including both Chroma-VQGAN and Hybrid-Transformer) from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/luckyhzt/unicolor-pretrained-model/tree/main):
- Trained model with ImageNet - put the file `mscoco_step259999.ckpt` under folder `framework/checkpoints/unicolor_imagenet`.
- Trained model with MSCOCO - put the file `imagenet_step142124.ckpt` under folder `framework/checkpoints/unicolor_mscoco`.

To use exemplar-based colorization, download the [pretrained models](https://github.com/zhangmozhe/Deep-Exemplar-based-Video-Colorization/releases/download/v1.0/colorization_checkpoint.zip) from [Deep-Exemplar-based-Video-Colorization](https://github.com/zhangmozhe/Deep-Exemplar-based-Video-Colorization), unzip the file and place the files into the corresponding folders:
- `video_moredata_l1` under the `sample/ImageMatch/checkpoints` folder
- `vgg19_conv.pth` and `vgg19_gray.pth` under the `sample/ImageMatch/data` folder

## Sampling
In `sample/sample.ipynb`, we show how to use our framework to perform unconditional, stroke-based, exemplar-based, and text-based colorization.

## Training
### Data preparation
Run `framework/datasets/data_prepare.py` to preprocess the datasets. This process will generate .yaml files for training and superpixel images which are used to extract hint points for training.
- For ImageNet, place the dataset in a folder with two sub-folders `train` and `val`, and run:
```
python framework/datasets/data_prepare.py $your_imagenet_dir$ imagenet --num_process $num_of_process$
```
- For COCO2017 dataset, place the dataset in a folder with three sub-folders `train2017`, `unlabeled2017` and `val2017`, and run:
```
python framework/datasets/data_prepare.py $your_coco2017_dir$ coco --num_process $num_of_process$
```

## Comments
Thanks to the authors who make their code and pretrained models publicly available:
- Our code is built based on "[Taming Transformers for High-Resolution Image Synthesis](https://github.com/CompVis/taming-transformers)".
- In exemplar-based colorization, we rely on code from "[Deep Exemplar-based Video Colorization](https://github.com/zhangmozhe/Deep-Exemplar-based-Video-Colorization)" to calculate the similarity between grayscale and reference images.
- In text-based colorization, we use "[CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training)](https://github.com/openai/CLIP)" to calculate text-image relevance.
